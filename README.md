Romeo VS Juliette is a 2-players duel game where you win by reaching the crown lying in the other player castle. 

Start the game : 
  - in the folder pico-8_console, launch the pico8 console required by your OS
  - if required, get to window view by pressing alt + enter
  - drag and drop romeoVjuliette.p8.png in the console screen
  - start the game by hitting ctrl + R

Get to the next screen by reaching the door (right for Juliette, left for Romeo).

You impersonate the infamous Shakespeare's characters -or at least our vision of them, which might not be really academic...

Move Juliette with the arrow keys / X (attack) / W (parry)
Move Romeo with ESDF / Q (attack) / Z (parry)
